-> Languages used :  <br />
   front-end - html,css,js <br />

    my_app/algorithm.py file  <br />
-> Model is created by processing 5000 Movies dataset collected from tmdb  <br />
-> to run the application in your local system run command  <br />
    python manage.py runserver   <br />

->  Password hashers used - bcrypt,django[argon2]  <br />
